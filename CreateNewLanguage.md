# Create New Language #

All the languages that come with the release are placed under [prettify.lang](http://cws1989.github.io/java-prettify/prettify/lang/package-summary.html) package. All languages should extends the [prettify.lang.Lang](http://cws1989.github.io/java-prettify/prettify/lang/Lang.html) class. You can take a look at [prettify.lang.LangLisp](https://github.com/cws1989/java-prettify/blob/master/src/prettify/lang/LangLisp.java) to see what should be done to make a new brush.

You can also submit the request as an issue to https://github.com/cws1989/java-prettify/issues.
